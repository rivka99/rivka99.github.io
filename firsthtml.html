		<div id="anotherc"> <h3> My GWC projects </h3>
		<p> There were many projects I did throughout the duration of the program, I listed a few of them below.
		</div>
		<ul> 
		<li> Runner Game: a game that required a code that allowed an image to follow the curser around the screen, and collect objects to pick up points. I coded this game using python.

		</li>
		
		<li>Obamicon project: In this project we used a picture from Obama's campaign and created a code that changed another picture to have the same color effect. </li>
		<li> <img 
		src ="WIN_20160802_11_22_54_Pro.jpg" alt="Picture of the obamified bernie photo ">  </li>
        <li>Robot Dance: This was one of the projects in which we programmed actual robots. We used code to make the robot move in different directions and we timed it to follow the beat of a song.

		</li>
         <li>Mad Libs: This was one of the simpler projects, but it was really fun to create and play. I used a lot of variables to make this game, and when playing it I got some funny results.
